# Calendar Links

This extension a liberal port of the "CiviCRM Add to Calendar" Drupal 7 module (https://www.drupal.org/project/civicrm_add_to_calendar) as a CiviCRM native extension. It can therefore be used with Drupal 7, 8 or 9, WordPress, Joomla or any other CMS that integrates with CiviCRM.

# Configuration

There currently is no configuration screen for this extension, once enabled all event will show embelished calendar links, with the addition of a Google Calendar link.

Minimal settings were available in the original extension, but have not been ported over. This extension is modular and further calendar links could be integrated in the future.
